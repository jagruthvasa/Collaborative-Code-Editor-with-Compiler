# Collaborative Code Editor with Compiler

Code Labs is a real-time interactive web-based lab made for students &amp; teachers/interviewers. On codelabs students can practice live programming and teachers can monitor them. Teachers/ interviewers can conduct coding contests, monitor students code at every stage and give suggestions. Students can run the code and check the output on our platform itself. The admin can download the code files of students that took part in their room/contest.

## Features :
1) Create room: The admin (teacher) creates a room with a secret link and password. 
2) Join the room: Participants who have the link and password can enter the room and complete their programming tasks, assigned by teachers. 
3) Code Editor: The code editor supports 4 major programming languages: C, C++, Java, and Python. It also has the enter, exit, run, and Submit functions. 
4) Real-time live coding: In real time, the admin(teacher) can manage the room, guide and verify each student's specific code.
